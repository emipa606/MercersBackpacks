--- Original Description ---

A tiny mod made while one of BaRKy's streams.
It adds backpacks for increased carrying capacity

Small Backpack adds 75 carrying capacity, which doubles the base value.

Large Backpack adds 150 carrying capacity, which triples the base value.

Carrying Capacity is capped by the stack limit so without any other mods this only works on pawns with less than 75 carrying capacity due to injuries. You will need to choose a mod for yourself for that aspect.

Shoutout to Proxyer who did the japanese translation. All credits for that go to him.
